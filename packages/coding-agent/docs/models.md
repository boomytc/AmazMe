# Choose a Model

For a built-in provider, start with `/login`, then choose a model with `/model`. Use custom model configuration when AmazMe does not already include the provider or endpoint you need.

## Choose a connection

| What you have | Recommended setup |
|---|---|
| A supported subscription | Sign in through `/login` |
| A provider API key | Store it through `/login` or set its environment variable |
| A local GGUF model | Connect AmazMe to a running llama.cpp router |
| An OpenAI-, Anthropic-, or Google-compatible endpoint | Add it to `models.json` |
| A provider with a custom protocol or authentication flow | Build or install a provider extension |

Browse the upstream [Pi model catalog](https://pi.dev/models) for provider metadata. AmazMe starts with its bundled catalog and can overlay newer catalog data from pi.dev. Cached catalog data remains available offline; run `amazme update --models` to force a refresh.

## Authenticate

Run `/login` and select a provider. AmazMe stores credentials in [`auth.json`](configuration.md#agent-directory). Run `/logout` to remove stored credentials for a provider. OAuth retains Pi's provider client IDs, callback configuration and request identity.

You can instead provide an API key through the provider's environment variable. This is useful in CI and other environments where AmazMe should not write credentials. [Providers](providers.md) lists the variables and provider-specific setup.

When several credential sources are configured, AmazMe uses a runtime `--api-key` first, then a stored `auth.json` credential, an `apiKey` from `models.json`, and finally the provider's environment variables or ambient cloud credentials. Provider extensions can define their own authentication behavior.

Keep `auth.json` and any credential commands private. Project settings and extensions can execute inside the AmazMe process after you trust a project. Review [Security](security.md) before loading configuration from an untrusted directory.

## Select a model

Run `/model` to choose an available model. The default terminal lists models whose providers have usable authentication. Choosing one changes the current conversation; set `defaultProvider` and `defaultModel` in settings to choose defaults for new sessions.

Press `Shift+Tab` to cycle thinking levels supported by the current model. Use `--thinking` for a startup override, or `defaultThinkingLevel` and `modelThinkingLevels` in settings for defaults.

`Ctrl+P` cycles forward and `Shift+Ctrl+P` cycles backward on Unix. Use `--models 'provider/first:high,provider/second:low'` for an ordered process-local scope, or configure `enabledModels` through [Settings](settings.md#model-cycling). Patterns support exact IDs, fuzzy matches and case-insensitive globs. Authentication changes are checked on each cycle. `/model` remains available outside the cycle scope. The SDK's optional interactive UI also provides `/thinking`, `/scoped-models` and save-default actions.

A new session prefers its saved default when that model is in scope, otherwise the first available scoped model. Explicit `--model` takes priority. Scope thinking suffixes take priority over per-model and global defaults; explicit `--thinking` wins at startup. Cycling uses the target's defaults and clamps them to its capabilities. A session records model and thinking-level changes. Resuming restores them without changing defaults for new sessions; a scope alone does not replace the saved selection.

## Connect local models

AmazMe's provider layer integrates with the llama.cpp router. Start the router separately and use `/model` to select an available model. The SDK's optional interactive UI provides `/llama` management; the default terminal does not expose that command.

Follow [Local Models with llama.cpp](llama-cpp.md) for server startup, model layout, downloads, and connection troubleshooting.

For Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM, SGLang, and other compatible servers, [configure a compatible endpoint](#configure-a-compatible-endpoint) in `models.json`.

## Configure a compatible endpoint

Use [`models.json`](configuration.md#agent-directory) when an endpoint speaks an API Pi already supports. This includes most Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM, SGLang, and proxy deployments.

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "ollama": {
      "baseUrl": "http://localhost:11434/v1",
      "api": "openai-completions",
      "apiKey": "ollama",
      "models": [
        { "id": "qwen2.5-coder:7b" }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The dummy key makes the model available to Pi; Ollama ignores it. For an authenticated endpoint, `apiKey` and header values can use `$NAME` or `${NAME}` environment interpolation, a literal value, or a leading `!command`. Commands in `models.json` run at request time and are not cached by Pi.

Restart the default terminal after editing `models.json`; the hosted model service and the SDK expose their own refresh operations. A `models` entry adds or replaces a model with the same ID on that provider. Use `modelOverrides` to change metadata for an existing built-in or extension-provided model without replacing the provider's model list. Unknown override IDs are ignored.

### Describe model input and caching

Use `inputLimits.images.resize` to control how Pi encodes new image attachments, `read` results, and tool-result images before storing them in conversation history:

```json
{
  "id": "vision-model",
  "input": ["text", "image"],
  "inputLimits": {
    "images": {
      "resize": {
        "maxWidth": 1568,
        "maxHeight": 1568,
        "maxBytes": 524288,
        "jpegQuality": 75
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`maxBytes` limits the base64-encoded payload. Omitted resize fields use conservative defaults of 2000 by 2000 pixels, 4.5 MiB encoded, and JPEG quality 80. Images are encoded once; changing models does not rewrite historical images. The catalog can also describe hard request limits with `inputLimits.maxRequestBytes`, `images.maxPerMessage`, and `images.maxPerRequest`, but Pi does not yet rewrite or reject history based on them.

<a id="prompt-cache-lifetimes"></a>

Use `promptCache` to declare the provider's best-effort cache lifetime in seconds for the `short` or `long` retention tier:

```json
{ "id": "claude-sonnet-5", "promptCache": { "short": 300, "long": 3600 } }
```

Choose the conservative end of any published range. A model without a lifetime for the active tier is not eligible for cache warming. A `modelOverrides` entry can set `inputLimits` or `promptCache` for a built-in or extension model, including a model accessed through a validated proxy. See [`cacheWarming`](settings.md#model-and-thinking).

### Configure sampling by thinking level

OpenAI-compatible APIs support free-form `samplingParams` model defaults and `samplingParamsByThinkingLevel` overrides. The latter uses Pi thinking-level keys (`off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, and `max`), not provider values from `thinkingLevelMap`:

```json
{
  "id": "qwen-thinking-model",
  "reasoning": true,
  "samplingParams": {
    "temperature": 1.0,
    "top_p": 0.95
  },
  "samplingParamsByThinkingLevel": {
    "off": {
      "temperature": 0.7,
      "top_p": 0.8
    },
    "high": {
      "top_k": 20
    }
  }
}
```

Pi first clamps unsupported thinking levels, then merges model `samplingParams`, the effective level's override, and request-level `samplingParams` in that order. Later values win per key. Missing levels inherit the model defaults. `modelOverrides` merges per-level entries per key with the base model. These fields apply only to `openai-completions`, `openai-responses`, and `azure-openai-responses`; other APIs ignore them.

Compatibility settings should describe verified differences in the endpoint's request or response behavior. Do not enable them based only on an endpoint advertising OpenAI or Anthropic compatibility.

## Use classifier models

Classifier models do not chat. They answer typed questions about JSON state: pick one of several choices, answer yes or no, or give a score, each with probabilities. Pi includes TypeSafe's Jev model from these providers, Cloudflare's Clef and Clef Flash models from Workers AI, and OpenAI's GPT-6 Luna through the [Decisions API](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/decisions):

| Provider | Model IDs | Authentication |
|---|---|---|
| `typesafe` | `jev-latest` | `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` |
| `openrouter` | `typesafe/jev-1.13`, `~typesafe/jev-latest` | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` or `/login` |
| `cloudflare-workers-ai` | `typesafe/jev`, `@cf/cloudflare/clef`, `@cf/cloudflare/clef-flash` | `CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY` and `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` |
| `vercel-ai-gateway` | `typesafe-ai/jev` | `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` |
| `opencode` | `jev-1.13`, `jev-1.13-free` | `OPENCODE_API_KEY` |
| `openai` | `gpt-6-luna` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` |

Chat models on a [llama.cpp router](llama-cpp.md#classification) are also listed as classifier models.

OpenAI's Decisions API needs an API key. Sign in with ChatGPT credentials do not work with it, so `gpt-6-luna` is not listed as available while `openai` is logged in through `/login`, even when `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set; log out of `openai` to use the key. GPT-6 Luna also judges images passed in `images` (see [Codemode](codemode.md#classify)); other classifier models return an error for them. The API rejects inputs above 922K tokens, but requests that run longer than about five seconds, currently above roughly 600K input tokens, fail with a gateway timeout.

Classifier models do not appear in `/model`. The model reaches them through the [`codemode`](cli.md#enable-codemode) tool, which is off unless an MCP server turned it on. Enable it with `"defaultTools": ["+codemode"]` in [settings](settings.md#tools). Scripts then list classifier models with `models.getAvailableOfType("classifier")` and call `models.classify(model, { state, questions })`:

```js
const jev = await models.getModelOfType("classifier", "typesafe", "jev-latest");
const result = await models.classify(jev, {
  state: { message: "The change works, thanks." },
  questions: {
    approved: {
      type: "bool",
      instructions: "Does the user approve of the result?",
      criteria: { true: "Approval", false: "No approval" },
    },
  },
});
return result.answers;
```

[Codemode](codemode.md#classify) describes the question and answer types.

When the service reports token counts, as all System One services do, `result.usage` carries them with their cost. Pi adds the usage of a script's classifier calls to the `codemode` tool result, so it counts toward the session cost in the footer and `/session`. The cost uses the model's catalog price; models without one, such as TypeSafe's direct `jev-latest`, report tokens at no cost.

Extensions call classifiers through `ctx.modelRegistry.classify()`, without codemode. [Virtual models](virtual-models.md#route-requests) can use them to route requests; see the `jev-router.ts` example.

## Use image models

Image models generate images from a prompt and optional input images. Pi lists OpenRouter's image models, such as `google/gemini-2.5-flash-image` and `black-forest-labs/flux.2-pro`, under the `openrouter` provider; they use the same `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` or `/login` credential as its chat models.

Like classifier models, image models do not appear in `/model`; the model reaches them through the [`codemode`](cli.md#enable-codemode) tool. Scripts list them with `models.getAvailableOfType("image")` and call `models.generateImages(model, { input })`. The result's `output` holds base64 image blocks, which `image()` attaches to the `codemode` result so the model sees them:

```js
const painter = await models.getModelOfType("image", "openrouter", "google/gemini-2.5-flash-image");
const result = await models.generateImages(painter, {
  input: [{ type: "text", text: "A red fox in the snow, watercolor" }],
});
if (result.stopReason !== "stop") return result.errorMessage;
for (const block of result.output) if (block.type === "image") image(block);
```

`input` can also contain `{ type: "image", data, mimeType }` blocks to edit or use as references. Pi adds the usage of a script's image calls to the `codemode` tool result, like classifier calls. Generated images are not saved to disk. [Codemode](codemode.md#generate-images) describes the full API.

Extensions generate images through `ctx.modelRegistry.generateImages()`, without codemode.

## Add a custom provider

Use an extension when the provider needs custom streaming, model discovery, or authentication behavior. See [Custom Providers](custom-provider.md) for the extension workflow.

## Troubleshooting

### A model does not appear

Confirm that its provider has usable authentication. Custom models can load from `models.json` but remain unavailable in `/model` until Pi can resolve credentials. For llama.cpp, only models currently loaded by the router appear.

### Authentication works in one shell only

Check whether the key came from an environment variable rather than `auth.json`. Environment variables must be present in the process that starts Pi.

### Sign-in opens a browser on a remote machine

Complete the provider's headless authentication flow when available. Some providers let you paste the final redirect URL or authorization code back into Pi. See [Authenticate interactively](providers.md#authenticate-interactively).

### A compatible endpoint rejects requests

Check its API type and compatibility settings in `models.json`. The upstream server must support the corresponding request fields and behavior.
