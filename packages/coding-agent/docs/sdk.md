# SDK

`@amazme/coding-agent` embeds AmazMe in a Node.js or Bun process. It provides direct TypeScript access to the agent, sessions, tools, models, and resources used by the command-line application.

Use the SDK for in-process TypeScript integration. For a language-independent or isolated subprocess, see [CLI Integration](cli-integration.md).

`main(args, { extensionFactories })` embeds the scripted CLI and requires Print/JSON/RPC mode for inline SDK factories. The default terminal selects native facet sources through `-e`; it does not adapt SDK factories into facets. Plain CLI help and model listing do not evaluate those factories.

```typescript
import { createAgentSession } from "@amazme/coding-agent";

const { session } = await createAgentSession();

try {
  await session.prompt("What files are in the current directory?");
  console.log(session.getLastAssistantText());
} finally {
  session.dispose();
}
```

This uses the working directory, discovered resources, stored settings, and configured credentials. `prompt()` resolves when the run finishes.

The [complete minimal example](../examples/sdk/01-minimal.ts) also streams text events. All [SDK examples](../examples/sdk/) are typechecked with the repository.

## Session lifecycle

`createAgentSession()` creates an `AgentSession`. The session owns one conversation, its model and tools, queued messages, compaction state, and extension runtime.

Read current state through `session.messages`, `session.model`, `session.thinkingLevel`, `session.systemPrompt`, and `session.getActiveToolNames()`.

`session.systemPrompt` is read-only and returns the current effective system prompt, including changes that have not yet been sent to the model. Tool changes are declared to the model before the next request.

<a id="sessionmanager-api"></a>

### Session storage

Sessions are persistent by default. `SessionManager` owns the persisted or in-memory entry tree and tracks its active leaf. Branching changes that leaf without deleting abandoned branches. When Pi reconstructs model context, the manager selects the active branch and applies compaction.

`SessionManager` is authoritative for finalized model context. Restore external history by constructing the session with a manager containing those entries. Assigning `session.agent.state.messages` does not replace persisted context.

`getLastUserMessageText()` reads the latest raw user prompt on the active branch, even if compaction removed it from model context. Session listings expose the same saved-branch text as `SessionInfo.lastUserMessage`, separately from `firstMessage`. Image-only prompts return `[Image]`; branches without a user prompt return an empty string.

Use an in-memory manager when the host does not want session files:

```typescript
import { createAgentSession, SessionManager } from "@amazme/coding-agent";

const { session } = await createAgentSession({
  sessionManager: SessionManager.inMemory(),
});
```

See the checked [sessions example](../examples/sdk/11-sessions.ts) for creating, opening, continuing, listing, and forking sessions. [Session File Format](session-format.md) defines the persisted JSONL contract, and [Message Types](message-types.md) defines transcript values. For exact methods and signatures, use the exported TypeScript declarations or [`session-manager.ts`](../src/core/session-manager.ts).

`cwd` selects the workspace used for project resource discovery, context files, session grouping, and built-in tool paths. Pass it explicitly when the target differs from `process.cwd()`.

`session.dispose()` aborts active work, invalidates extension contexts, disconnects from the agent, and removes event listeners. Call it when the session is no longer needed.

`AgentSessionRuntime` adds `newSession()`, `switchSession()`, `fork()`, and `importFromJsonl()`. Each operation replaces the active `AgentSession` and recreates services for the target working directory.

After a runtime replacement, subscriptions belong to the old `AgentSession` and must be rebound. See the [session runtime example](../examples/sdk/13-session-runtime.ts).

## Prompting

`prompt()` handles extension commands and expands file-based prompt templates before ordinary user messages enter the agent. For an accepted agent run, it resolves after the run finishes, including automatic retries.

A prompt sent while the session is already streaming must specify whether it should steer the current run or follow it. Calling `prompt()` without that choice rejects rather than guessing.

A steering message enters after the current assistant turn and its tool calls. A follow-up enters after the current run finishes its pending work. `steer()` and `followUp()` expose those behaviors directly and return `"queued"` if the input was queued (including after an extension transformed it), or `"handled"` if an extension consumed it.

`abort()` stops the active operation and waits for the session to become idle. `waitForIdle()` waits without aborting it.

## Subscribing to events

Subscribe before prompting when the host needs streamed output:

```typescript
const unsubscribe = session.subscribe((event) => {
  if (event.type === "message_update" && event.assistantMessageEvent.type === "text_delta") {
    process.stdout.write(event.assistantMessageEvent.delta);
  }
});

try {
  await session.prompt("Explain this repository");
} finally {
  unsubscribe();
}
```

Session events report message updates, tool execution, queues, compaction, retries, and run lifecycle changes.

`message_end` contains the authoritative completed message. `agent_end` marks the end of one low-level agent run, but automatic recovery or queued work can still follow.

Use `agent_settled` when the host needs to know that Pi will not continue automatically.

## Configuring a session

Without overrides, the factory creates a `ModelRuntime`, file-backed `SettingsManager`, persistent `SessionManager`, `DefaultResourceLoader`, and the configured default tools.

Each boundary can be supplied explicitly:

- `modelRuntime`, `model`, `thinkingLevel`, and `scopedModels` control model access and selection.
- `settingsManager` supplies merged settings or an in-memory configuration.
- `sessionManager` supplies persistent or in-memory conversation history.
- `resourceLoader` supplies extensions, skills, prompt templates, themes, and context files.
- `tools`, `noTools`, `excludeTools`, and `customTools` control the active tool set.
  `tools: ["+grep", "-write"]` edits inherited defaults; plain names form an allowlist. Modifier entries require exact names and cannot mix with plain names. `excludeTools` applies last. Invalid lists reject before runtime creation or resource loading.

Use `DefaultResourceLoader` when you want standard discovery with selected overrides. Supply a custom `ResourceLoader` when the host owns resource storage and discovery completely.

<a id="inlineextension"></a>

Inline extension factories can be supplied through `DefaultResourceLoader`. Give one an `InlineExtension` name only when it needs a stable name in diagnostics and startup output. A named inline extension with `replaceable: true` is left out when another extension registers a tool, command, or flag with a name it registers during loading, instead of both loading with a conflict. The CLI's built-in codemode, tool search, and MCP extensions are replaceable. A named entry with `builtin: true` is not an inline extension: it supplies the code of the `builtin:<name>` extension, which loads like a configured extension file. It loads by default, is listed in `amazme config`, and is disabled by `-builtin:<name>` in the `extensions` setting or by `noExtensions`; `additionalExtensionPaths: ["builtin:<name>"]` loads it explicitly. It loads after project trust is resolved, so it cannot handle `project_trust`. The CLI's built-in extensions use it.

<a id="codemode-mcp"></a>

The CLI loads `codemode`, `tool_search`, and MCP as built-in extensions. SDK sessions do not; add `createCodemodeExtension()`, `createToolSearchExtension()`, and `createMcpExtension()` to the `extensionFactories` of `DefaultResourceLoader`. `codemode` and `tool_search` are registered inactive: enable them through the `defaultTools` setting (`["+codemode", "+tool_search"]` keeps the other default tools), or let the MCP extension activate them: `codemode` for servers with `codemode` exposure, `tool_search` for servers with `deferred` exposure. The MCP extension connects its servers on `session_start`, so call `session.bindExtensions()`. See [Codemode and MCP](../examples/sdk/14-codemode-mcp.ts).

See the focused examples for [models](../examples/sdk/02-custom-model.ts), [tools](../examples/sdk/05-tools.ts), [extensions](../examples/sdk/06-extensions.ts), and [full control](../examples/sdk/12-full-control.ts).

## Observed file tools

Built-in `edit` and replacement `write` require a successful `read` of the existing file. Files changed outside the tool chain must be read again. New-file writes never overwrite another writer's creation. Completed changes refresh the observation, so subsequent edits can use them without another read. The session JSONL journal owns observations; reopening the same session restores them, while a fork or historical branch requires fresh reads. A bounded projection keeps at most 1024 targets per owner.

Standalone groups created by `createCodingTools()`, `createAllTools()` or their definition factories share one in-memory owner. Independent tools share only an explicitly supplied owner:

```typescript
import { createMemoryFileObservations, createReadTool, createEditTool } from "@amazme/coding-agent";

const observations = createMemoryFileObservations();
const read = createReadTool(process.cwd(), { observations });
const edit = createEditTool(process.cwd(), { observations });
await read.execute("read-1", { path: "app.ts" });
await edit.execute("edit-1", { path: "app.ts", edits: [{ oldText: "old", newText: "new" }] });
```

For another filesystem, supply `fileSystem` in the tool options (or group options). It implements the shared `FileSystem` contract from `@amazme/durable/env`, including opened-reader revisions and checked publication. SSH and Gondolin examples use the actual daemon protocol. Gondolin needs a Linux musl daemon for the guest architecture; `AMAZME_ENV_LINUX_BINARY` can point to that build when the package has no bundled binary. There is no unconditional read/write operations fallback. File namespaces must remain stable across connection recreation to restore observations and differ across isolated machines.

Cancellation waits for in-flight IO and required cleanup before releasing a mutation barrier. If publication already completed, the result reports success; unavailable observation persistence adds a reread warning. Checked publication rechecks cooperating writers but does not claim an operating-system lock against arbitrary external processes.
